### Executing the application

With your terminal navigated to the project root directory, run the application with the command `python -m lib.cli`.  We are adding the `-m` flag to let Python know that we are running a module.  The `lib.cli` is the module name.  The module name is the file path from the project root to the file we want to run.  In this case, we are running the `cli.py` file in the `lib` directory. This added consideration is necessary to allow our `pytests` to run properly.
